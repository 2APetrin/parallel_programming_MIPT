# Parallel programming MIPT course

Parallel programming course at MIPT introduced me to multi-threaded development.

### Theory course main topics:
- basic algorithms
- parallel strategies
- sorting algorithms (the most interesting for me)
- computational mesh decomposition
- data visualization
- numerical integration algorithms

Practical part covered basics of MPI and pthread libraries. The course consists of two labs, each has 3 tasks.

I would like to thank my lecturer for such an interesting course and my seminarian for informative classes with live coding.
